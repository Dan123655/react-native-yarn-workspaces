```
git clone git@github.com:Dan123655/react-native-yarn-workspaces.git
cd react-native-yarn-workspaces && yarn install
```
```
cd packages/<app_name>/ios && pod install
```
***"bad cpu/m1" pod-install-errors will probably be fixed by sudo rm -rf ~/.cocoapods/repos && pod install***

back to root directory and run any app with a script:
```
yarn adresartruhlaru:start
```
```
yarn walkplaces:start
```
