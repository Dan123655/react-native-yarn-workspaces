# monorepo - multiple workspaces

kickoff

```
cd monorepo && yarn install

```
cd packages/<app_name>/ios && pod install


bad cpu will probably be fixed by sudo rm -rf ~/.cocoapods/repos and then pod install

```

back to root directory and run app1 with this script:
yarn adresartruhlaru:start // yarn walkplaces:start

```
